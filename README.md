### Led research on US land use dynamics, culminating in a first author paper (under review).
- Sourced, cleaned, analyzed, visualized, and modeled data for research on the trends of US land cover by use, and its effects, including the novel implementation of a SUR model to investigate the interaction of land use types along with socioeconomic and public policy exogenous variables.
- One major finding follows: > We found that the acreage of each given land cover type (of cropland, pasture, forest, hay, developed open land, and developed non-open land) can predict with statistical significance the acreage of most other land cover types. Most notably from the interactions of different land cover types, the equations for cropland and forest suggest a major difference between the presence of open (very low density) and non-open developed land, with the presence of open developed land predicting a large increase in cropland and forest acreage within a given county, and with non-open development predicting a large decrease of the same, all else equal. We also find significant predictability from median income, the number of households within a county, and year fixed effects (all as controls), but most interestingly from Tennessee Agricultural Enhancement Program investment, a cost-share initiative. For each additional $1,000 USD in TAEP investment, a given county is expected to have 86 more acres of cropland, 127 more acres of pasture, and 27 more acres of hay, with 60 less acres of forest, seven less acres of open development, and four less acres of non-open development, all else equal.

### Developed an farmer-facing dashboard providing previosuly unavailable resources
- Built for the TN Department of Agriculture to make production trends, trial results, and checkoff and trial center locations accesible to corn, soy, and livestock producers.

- Created automations for the extraction of data for research in Tennessee farmland price trends, then developed a regression model to investigate hypotheses for future research
- 
- Created dozens of public-facing geospatial dashboards on land use and agriculture
